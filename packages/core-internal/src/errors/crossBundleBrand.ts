/**
 * Cross-bundle `instanceof` support for the SDK error classes.
 *
 * `@modelcontextprotocol/client` and `@modelcontextprotocol/server` each bundle their
 * own copy of `core-internal`, so an error constructed by one package fails a
 * prototype-identity `instanceof` against the same class re-exported by the other —
 * exactly the check a dual-role process (gateway, host, in-process test) writes.
 *
 * Instead of prototype identity, branded classes stamp every instance with the brand
 * strings of its class chain under a registry symbol (`Symbol.for`, shared across
 * bundles and realms), and resolve `instanceof` via `Symbol.hasInstance` against the
 * brand set. Ordinary prototype-based `instanceof` is kept as a fallback so behavior
 * is unchanged for anything unbranded.
 *
 * A class participates by declaring an **own** `static readonly mcpBrand` and (for
 * hierarchy roots) installing {@linkcode brandedHasInstance} as `Symbol.hasInstance`.
 * User-defined subclasses that do not declare their own brand keep plain prototype
 * semantics — a foreign base-class instance never satisfies `instanceof UserSubclass`.
