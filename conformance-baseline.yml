# MCP Conformance Test Expected Failures
# List scenario names that are known to fail in this SDK.
# Format:
#   server:
#     - scenario-name-1
#     - scenario-name-2
#   client:
#     - scenario-name-3
#
# The conformance runner will:
#   - Exit 0 if only expected failures occur
#   - Exit 1 if unexpected failures occur (regression)
#   - Exit 1 if expected failures now pass (stale baseline, update this file)
