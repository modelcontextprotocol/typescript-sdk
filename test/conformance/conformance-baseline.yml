# Known conformance test failures for v1.x
# These are tracked and should be removed as they're fixed.
#
# tools_call: conformance runner's test server reuses a single Server
# instance across requests, triggering v1.26.0's "Already connected"
# guard (GHSA-345p-7cg4-v4c7). Fixed in conformance repo (PR #141),
# remove this entry once a new conformance release is published.
#
# auth/pre-registration: scenario added in conformance 0.1.11 that
# requires a dedicated client handler for pre-registered credentials.
# Needs to be implemented in both v1.x and main.
