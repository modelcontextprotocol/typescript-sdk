# Roadmap

## Spec Implementation Tracking

The SDK tracks implementation of MCP spec components via GitHub Projects, with a dedicated project board for each spec revision. For example, see the [2025-11-25 spec revision board](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/projects/26).

## Current Focus Areas

### Next Spec Revision

The next MCP specification revision is being developed in the [protocol repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol). Key areas expected in the next revision include extensions and stateless transports.

The SDK has historically implemented spec changes promptly as they are finalized, with dedicated project boards tracking component-level progress for each revision.

### v2

A major version of the SDK is in active development, tracked via [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/projects/31). Target milestones:

- **Alpha**: ~mid-March 2026
- **Beta**: ~May 2026

The v2 release is planned to align with the next spec release, expected around mid-2026.
